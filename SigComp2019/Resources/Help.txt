This generic signature verification module, created for SigComp2019 compares
a questioned signature with some authentic (reference) signatures of a given 
writer and calculates comparsion score and evidential value of this score.  
Comparsion score shows the probability of the sample being a genuine signature
and evidential score is expressed as the ratio of the probabilities of finding
that score when the questioned signature is a genuine signature and when it is
a forgery.
